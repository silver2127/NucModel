# Repository Guidelines

This project hosts a lightweight financial model of a nuclear power plant. When updating the Python code, please follow these steps to keep the model working:

1. Run `python -m py_compile plant.py` to confirm the main script compiles.
2. Execute `python plant.py` to ensure the default calculation runs.
3. Run the unit tests with `pytest` for extra validation.

See the README for more details on usage and development practices.
